### **Welcome to Zoomaster!**
Zoomaster is a Java application for the Command Line. It provides you with a simple and intuitive way to store your Zoom links for your online classes, alongside other useful links for the lesson at hand.<br/>

Zoomaster can also intelligently determine the current lesson you are having, allowing you to launch the correct links quickly and elegantly from the command line.

## **Getting Started**
Refer to the setting up guide over [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-1/tp/releases).






## **Design**

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

{if you have not organized the code into clearly divided components (no penalty if you didn't), you can use a single class diagram (if it is not too complicated) or use several class diagrams each describing a different area of the system.}

### Architecture

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/Ui.java)

The UI is responsible for all visual output to the User from the app. It utilises the `Jansi` library to enable the usage of ANSI escape codes to format the console, allowing the app to output in colour. <br/>

The UI also receives input from the User using a `Scanner` object. It returns the input as a String to the main function. <br/>

In addition, the UI contains the different exception and error messages which can be displayed. When a particular exception is thrown (eg. **UNKNOWN_INPUT**), the corresponding function is called in UI to print out the error message (**printUnknownInputMessage()**). 


The `UI` component,

* Receives user commands and returns to the Main function.
* Prints visual output in the console for the User

## **Implementation**

This section explains the implementations of Zoomaster features. It goes through the step-by-step proccess, expected outcomes of each feature and the design considerations.

### Bookmark and Timetable modes feature (TYS)

Zoomaster stores two lists of information from users. One the list of bookmarks with link to online resources and second the list of timetable slots. To simplify input commands for users, both lists has the same keywords for adding, deleting, editing? and showing items in the lists. Hence by having seperating both list into different modes allows both lists to access the same keywords without causing conflicts when parsing commands.

#### Implementation

This feature extends Command class with a way to toggle between different modes of Zoomaster. The integer variable used to control the modes is stored in the Parser class called "programMode". Additionally, it implements the following operation:
* getModeFromCommand() - Decodes the command sent by the users to figure out which mode the user wants to move to.

Given below is a sequential diagram of how changing between modes occur.

![](https://github.com/TYS0n1/tp/blob/team-Branch2/docs/diagrams/ChangeModeCommand%20seq%20dia.png?raw=true) <br/><br/>

Step 1. When the App gets a command from the user to change modes, a new ChangeModeCommand object is created.

Step 2. The ChangeModeCommand passes the command through getModeFromCommand() function to decode the mode the user wishes to change to.

Step 3. The App now executes the command and changes to the respective mode. If an invalid mode was given by the user or if the input field was empty, the execute function throws an exception and tells the user valid modes for the App.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![](https://github.com/TYS0n1/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/ChangeModeCommand%20action%20dia.png?raw=true) 

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to store programMode variable for security

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** No security
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: May introduce errors to the App if variable is changed outside of ChangeModeCommand class objects.
* **Alternative 2:** Private variable and implement mode changing inside Parser class
    * Pros: Ensure the App does not change modes outside commands to change modes.
    * Cons: Reduces OOP standard of code by decoupling ChangeModeCommand from Command class and increases code complexity.


### Add Module and Slot feature (Xing Rong)
This feature allows the user to add modules and lesson slots into the timetable.
Users can also add bookmarks to specific modules and slots.
Users can enter one-shot-commands, adding multiple slots and bookmarks to a module.

Given below is a sequence diagram of how the feature works.
![](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/addSlotSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true)
<br>
<br>
Step 1. After calling execute() method of the AddSlotCommand object, there will be a check on whether the module code 
entered by the user already exists in the timetable. If it does not exist, then the module will be created.

Step 2. There will then be a check for additional commands pertaining to the module entered by the user.

Step 3. The code will then check if the command is to add a module bookmark or a lesson slot, and do so accordingly.

Step 4. If the command is to add a lesson slot, then there will be check for a bookmark entry in the command. If there 
is one, then the bookmark will be added to the lesson slot.

Step 5. Loop to step 3 if there are additional commands which have not been executed.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to enable fast typing users to add modules, slots and related bookmarks faster
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** allowing one shot command to add slots and bookmarks to a module
    * Pros: Allow one shot command
    * Cons: Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** separate adding of modules, lesson slots and related bookmarks into different commands
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Pros: Lower chance of error
    * Cons: User has to enter multiple commands each at a time to perform the functions, which takes up more time.


## **Product scope**
### Target user profile

Our target users are NUS students with fast typing skills.

### Value proposition

The App was developed during the coronavirus pandemic whereby many NUS classes have been transitioned towards online lessons. NUS lessons are mainly conducted on Zoom video conferencing software. However, as Zoom does not store recurring nor past meetings, it is hard for students to easily access their online lessons. Hence, our App helps to organise studentsâ€™ Zoom links for easy access to their lesson.

## **User Stories**
