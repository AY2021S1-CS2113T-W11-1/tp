## Overview

Our team has developed a command line interface application called Zoomaster which helps NUS students to store 
information of their lesson timetable and website links. Zoomaster can launch the stored websites such as zoom links 
in a quick and convenient way, and has a feature to help students plan for group meetings by collating their timetable.

#### Enhancements implemented:  
* The ability for the user to enter multiple commands in one shot when adding a module to the timetable. 
The user can add lesson slots, and bookmarks to the module as well as the lesson slots in one command, instead of 
entering the details one line at a time, allowing fast typists to set up their timetable faster.
* Support for launching URLs on the different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux and Unix.
